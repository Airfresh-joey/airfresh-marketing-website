# How to Choose the Right Experiential Agency for Your Brand

Selecting the right experiential marketing agency can make the difference between a forgettable activation and a campaign that transforms your brand's market presence. Here's your comprehensive guide to making the right choice.

## 1. Proven Experience in Experiential Campaigns

### Look for Track Record
An agency's portfolio tells the real story. At Air Fresh Marketing, our 10+ years of experience spans thousands of campaigns for brands like Google, Adidas, Microsoft, and the NFL.

While versatility matters, look for agencies with specific experience in your industry. Our portfolio spans technology, CPG, automotive, entertainment, and more.

## 2. Custom Experiential Strategies

### Beyond Cookie-Cutter Solutions
Every brand has unique challenges and opportunities. Avoid agencies that pitch one-size-fits-all solutions.

- Brand positioning analysis
- Target audience insights
- Competitive landscape review
- Marketing objectives alignment
- Success metrics definition

Can the agency execute in multiple markets simultaneously? Our nationwide network ensures consistent execution from New York to Los Angeles.

### Local Expertise
National reach means nothing without local insights. We maintain regional experts who understand:
- Local regulations and permits
- Cultural nuances and preferences
- Seasonal considerations

Modern experiential marketing demands real-time insights. We provide:
- Live dashboard access
- Daily performance reports
- Consumer interaction metrics
- Social media monitoring
- Lead generation tracking

### Comprehensive Metrics
Look for agencies that measure what matters:
- **Engagement Metrics**: Interactions, dwell time, participation rates
- **Conversion Metrics**: Samples distributed, leads captured, sales generated

- **ROI Metrics**: Cost per engagement, conversion rates, revenue attribution

### Post-Campaign Analysis
The best agencies provide actionable insights:
- Detailed performance reports
- Consumer behavior analysis
- Competitive benchmarking
- Optimization recommendations
- Future campaign planning

## 6. Collaborative, Client-First Approach

### Communication Excellence
Your agency should be an extension of your team:

# How Street Team Marketing Helped Grubhub Deliver More Than Just Food

When Grubhub needed to expand market share in competitive urban markets, they turned to Air Fresh Marketing's street teams to deliver something traditional advertising couldn't: authentic, personal connections at street level. The results? A 25% market share increase and 18,000 new app downloads in just 60 days.

## The Challenge: Breaking Through the Delivery App Noise

In 2023, Grubhub faced intense competition in three key markets:
- **New York City**: Dominated by multiple delivery platforms
- **Boston**: Strong local competitor presence
- **Philadelphia**: Low brand awareness despite market potential

Traditional digital advertising was yielding diminishing returns:
- High customer acquisition costs ($45+ per user)
- Ad fatigue among target demographics
- Low conversion rates (under 2%)
- Minimal brand differentiation

Grubhub needed a fresh approach that would:
1. Cut through digital clutter
2. Create memorable brand experiences
3. Drive immediate app downloads
4. Build lasting customer relationships
5. Deliver measurable ROI

## The Solution: Strategic Street Team Deployment

Air Fresh Marketing developed a comprehensive street team strategy tailored to each market's unique characteristics.
