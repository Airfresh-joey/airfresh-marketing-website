Goal: improve quote funnel conversion on the main `/get-quote` path.

Shipped candidate:
- Fixed staff role selection in the multi-step quote form so clicking the checkbox no longer double-toggles the selected role.
- This removes a conversion blocker on step 3 of the quote funnel where users could fail to select needed staff roles.

Checks:
- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed; generated 6,237 sitemap URLs.
- `npm run lint` attempted, but repo lint script is incompatible with current Next CLI and fails with: `Invalid project directory provided, no such directory: .../lint`.

Next actions:
- Commit, push, deploy to Vercel production, and verify `/get-quote` live.
- Fix stale `next lint` script/tooling in a separate cleanup if needed.
- Continue reviewing high-intent pages for CTAs that still send users to `/contact` instead of `/get-quote`.

Goal: send high-intent organic traffic directly into the quote funnel instead of the general contact page.

Shipped candidate:
- Updated the `/event-staffing-near-me` page's primary quote CTAs from `/contact` to `/get-quote`.
- Added source/intent query parameters to the quote links so future analytics can distinguish hero, custom staffing, unlisted city, SEO body, and final CTA clicks.
- Left the footer Contact link as `/contact` because it is navigational, not a conversion CTA.

Checks:
- `npm run check` passed.
- `npm run build` passed; generated 6,133 sitemap URLs and 6,303 static pages.
- Pending: deploy and verify live.

Next actions:
- Continue the CTA sweep on other high-intent service pages after this deploy verifies.
